<p class=""p1"">Pink Himalayan Cooking Salt Block Combo with Bag and Tray (20cm x 20cm x 5cm)</p>
<p class=""p1""><meta charset=""utf-8""><meta charset=""utf-8""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-7839e0f3-7fff-16af-d064-5cfaf68c18fa""><span>Make your man’s day this Valentines with this Cooking Salt Block Combo - his friends will be green with envy!</span></b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Using a pink Himalayan salt block is an innovative and flavourful way to braai meat. These blocks are naturally harvested from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan and are prized for their mineral-rich composition, which imparts a unique taste to food.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When used for braaing, the salt block acts as both a cooking surface and a seasoning agent, subtly infusing the meat with a savoury saltiness while locking in moisture. To use, heat the block slowly over a braai until it reaches the desired temperature. Once heated, it retains heat evenly, ensuring a consistent cooking experience.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The salt block is versatile and can be used for searing steaks, grilling vegetables, or even as a serving platter, adding a touch of gourmet flair to any meal. It’s also naturally anti-microbial, making it easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For best results, allow the block to cool gradually after use, and clean it with a damp cloth. Avoid using detergents, as they can seep into the block and affect the taste of future dishes. With proper care, a pink Himalayan salt block can last for many braais, enhancing the flavour and presentation of your culinary creations.</p>",Default Title,Title,Default Title,42388399522045,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0081/6968/5089/files/pink-himalayan-cooking-salt-block-20cm-x-20cm-x-5cm-223882.jpg?v=1738238787

These blocks are naturally harvested from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan and are prized for their mineral-rich composition, which imparts a unique taste to food.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When used for braaing, the salt block acts as both a cooking surface and a seasoning agent, subtly infusing the meat with a savoury saltiness while locking in moisture. To use, heat the block slowly over a braai until it reaches the desired temperature. Once heated, it retains heat evenly, ensuring a consistent cooking experience.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The salt block is versatile and can be used for searing steaks, grilling vegetables, or even as a serving platter, adding a touch of gourmet flair to any meal. It’s also naturally anti-microbial, making it easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For best results, allow the block to cool gradually after use, and clean it with a damp cloth. Avoid using detergents, as they can seep into the block and affect the taste of future dishes. With proper care, a pink Himalayan salt block can last for many braais, enhancing the flavour and presentation of your culinary creations.</p>",Default Title,Title,Default Title,42388399522045,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0081/6968/5089/files/pink-himalayan-cooking-salt-block-20cm-x-20cm-x-5cm-223882.jpg?v=1738238787

<p>* <meta charset=""utf-8""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Salty liquorice, salmiak liquorice or salmiac liquorice, is a variety of liquorice flavoured with the ingredient ""salmiak salt"", and is a common confection found in the Nordic countries, Benelux, and northern Germany.</span></p>
<p>Founded in 1890 in Amsterdam by Gerrit van Voornveld the factory soon captured a central position in the market. During the 1890s an influenza epidemic caused a tremendous increase of the demand for cough suppressing liquorice. Van Voornveld's liquorice recipe proved to be the perfect remedy against an aching throat and lyrax. At the beginning of the new century, the liquorice factory was taken over and the new owners renamed it in Venco (Voornveld and Companions). The new name was a tribute to the founder of the company. After 1945 in the wake of the fusion between Venco and Red Band the factory moved to Roosendaal. Today Venco is a leading liquorice brand in the Netherlands which becomes increasingly popular abroad.<br></p>",Default Title,Title,Default Title,42212773232893,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0081/6968/5089/files/venco-eurolijn-mintnopjes-120g-683101.jpg?v=1733866079

<p data-sourcepos=""1:1-1:45""><strong>Christmas Fruit Cake: A Festive Tradition</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos=""3:1-3:364"">Christmas fruit cake, a beloved holiday tradition, is a rich, dense cake packed with dried fruits, nuts, and spices. Traditionally, it's soaked in brandy or rum for months, giving it a deep, boozy flavour. This festive treat is often enjoyed during the holiday season, either sliced and served with custard or cream, or as a small bite with a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""9:1-9:314"">One of the unique features of Christmas fruit cake is its ability to keep for long periods of time. The high sugar content and alcohol content act as natural preservatives, allowing the cake to be stored for months or even years. This makes it a convenient and festive treat to enjoy throughout the holiday season.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""11:1-11:335"">While Christmas fruit cake is often associated with the holiday season, it can also be enjoyed year-round. Some people prefer to serve it as a dessert after a meal, while others enjoy it as a snack or a light breakfast. No matter how you choose to enjoy it, Christmas fruit cake is sure to add a touch of festive cheer to any occasion.</p>

After 1945 in the wake of the fusion between Venco and Red Band the factory moved to Roosendaal. Today Venco is a leading liquorice brand in the Netherlands which becomes increasingly popular abroad.<br></p>",Default Title,Title,Default Title,40462851703037,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0081/6968/5089/files/venco-eurolijn-schoolkrijt-120g-549513.jpg?v=1711625877

<p>A word from Santa Anna's:  <em>""To unlock the nutrients in the corn, we soak it in calcium hydroxide, produced from natural limestone, which changes the structure of corn through the ancient Mesoamerican process of nixtamalization.  We process the resulting nixtamal (corn cooked in lime water) the same way that it has been done for the last 4000 years: grind it with volcanic stones to produce masa (corn dough), turn the masa into tortillas, and hand-cut them before frying them into our golden corn chips. The final touch is lightly seasoning the chips with Oryx Desert Salt.""</em></p>

<p>Founded in 1890 in Amsterdam by Gerrit van Voornveld the factory soon captured a central position in the market. During the 1890s an influenza epidemic caused a tremendous increase of the demand for cough suppressing liquorice. Van Voornveld's liquorice recipe proved to be the perfect remedy against an aching throat and lyrax. At the beginning of the new century, the liquorice factory was taken over and the new owners renamed it in Venco (Voornveld and Companions). The new name was a tribute to the founder of the company. After 1945 in the wake of the fusion between Venco and Red Band the factory moved to Roosendaal.

It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, it is mixed with a hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel) and a shamoji (a wooden paddle).</p>
<p>Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.</p>
<p>Sushi Rice need to be cooked in a rice cooker or steamed. Do Not boil with excessive water.</p>

<p>Green banana flour can be used in a variety of recipes, including cookies, cakes, muffins, pancakes, and bread. It can also be used to thicken soups and stews.</p>
<p>Because of its super high starch content, you can use a lot less banana flour compared to regular ones. Generally, the rule of thumb is 30 percent less, depending on the recipe.

<p>Our Psyllium Husk is graded for human and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Psyllium husk is sometimes included in horses' diets for specific health-related reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Digestive health</strong>: Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which can help promote healthy digestion in horses. It forms a gel-like substance when mixed with water, which can help soften the stool and ease the passage of faeces through the digestive tract. This can be particularly beneficial in preventing or managing conditions such as colic or impaction.<br><br><strong>Sand clearance</strong>: Horses grazing on sandy pastures or those fed on a substrate that contains sand may inadvertently ingest small amounts of sand over time. This sand can accumulate in the digestive tract and lead to complications. Psyllium husk has been used as a laxative in horses to help facilitate the removal of sand from the intestines. It works by binding to the sand particles and increasing the bulk of the faeces, aiding in their elimination.<br><br><strong>Weight management</strong>: Psyllium husk can contribute to weight management in horses. As a source of fiber, it can provide a feeling of fullness, potentially reducing overeating and aiding in weight control.</p>
<p>When considering the use of psyllium husk for a horse, it is essential to consult with a veterinarian or equine nutritionist. They can provide guidance on the appropriate dosage, administration methods, and whether it is suitable for the specific needs of the horse. Additionally, psyllium husk should not be used as a substitute for proper management practices, such as providing clean water, feeding a balanced diet, and minimizing exposure to sandy environments.<br></p>

<p>Our Psyllium Husk is graded for human and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Psyllium husk is sometimes included in horses' diets for specific health-related reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Digestive health</strong>: Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which can help promote healthy digestion in horses. It forms a gel-like substance when mixed with water, which can help soften the stool and ease the passage of faeces through the digestive tract. This can be particularly beneficial in preventing or managing conditions such as colic or impaction.<br><br><strong>Sand clearance</strong>: Horses grazing on sandy pastures or those fed on a substrate that contains sand may inadvertently ingest small amounts of sand over time. This sand can accumulate in the digestive tract and lead to complications. Psyllium husk has been used as a laxative in horses to help facilitate the removal of sand from the intestines. It works by binding to the sand particles and increasing the bulk of the faeces, aiding in their elimination.<br><br><strong>Weight management</strong>: Psyllium husk can contribute to weight management in horses. As a source of fiber, it can provide a feeling of fullness, potentially reducing overeating and aiding in weight control.</p>
<p>When considering the use of psyllium husk for a horse, it is essential to consult with a veterinarian or equine nutritionist. They can provide guidance on the appropriate dosage, administration methods, and whether it is suitable for the specific needs of the horse. Additionally, psyllium husk should not be used as a substitute for proper management practices, such as providing clean water, feeding a balanced diet, and minimizing exposure to sandy environments.<br></p>

On the other hand, aluminium-free baking powder is a type of baking powder that does not contain aluminium, a common ingredient in many baking powders.</p>
<p>While there are no direct health benefits of using gluten-free or aluminium-free baking powder, they may be beneficial for people who have specific dietary requirements or sensitivities. For example, people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity must avoid gluten in their diets to prevent negative health effects. Using gluten-free baking powder can help them avoid consuming gluten.</p>
<p>Similarly, some people may be concerned about the potential health effects of consuming aluminium. Although the evidence linking aluminium intake to negative health effects is limited, some people may choose to avoid aluminium in their diets as a precautionary measure. Using aluminium-free baking powder can help them achieve this.</p>
<p>It's important to note that baking powder is typically used in small quantities in recipes, so the potential health benefits of using gluten-free or aluminium-free baking powder may be minimal. However, for those who need to avoid gluten or aluminium for dietary reasons, these baking powder types can be a helpful option.</p>",Default Title,Title,Default Title,39437260456189,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0081/6968/5089/products/baking-powder-gluten-and-aluminium-free-200g-331058.jpg?v=1692804991

With forests brimming with majestic red, black and sugar maples, the country has just the right mix of cold spring nights and warm daytime temperatures to produce an abundance of the clear-coloured sap used to make maple syrup.</p>
<p>HEALTH PROPERTIES | Maple sap contains about 97 percent water, plus minerals, organic acids and maple taste precursors. It takes 40 litres of sap to make one litre of syrup.</p>
<p>EARTH-CONSCIOUS | Canada’s maple syrup producers take great care to ensure the long term survival of their maple sugar bushes. | They collect only enough sap for one to 1.5 litres of syrup from each tree – or less than one-tenth of the tree’s sugar.</p>
